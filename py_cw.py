# Question 1   <--- Yes, so we know what question you think you're answering


"""
The complex numbers are explained here (and elsewhere):
 http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/complex-number-multiply.html
Represent a complex integer as a pair of integers, so (4,5) represents 4+5i (or 4+5j, depending on the complex numbers
notation you use).
1a. Using def, define functions cadd and cmult representing complex integer addition and
multiplication.
For instance,
 cadd((1,0),(0,1))
should compute
 (1,1).
1b. Python has its own native implementation of complex numbers. Write translation functions
tocomplex and fromcomplex that map the pair (x1,y1) to the complex number x1+(y1)j and vice 
versa. You may use the python methods real and imag without comment, but not complex 
(use j directly instead).

"""
2a. Using def, write iterative functions seqaddi and seqmulti that implement pointwise
addition and multiplication of integer sequences.
For instance
 seqaddi([1,2,3],[-1,2,2])
should compute
 [0,4,5]
You need not write error-handling code to handle the cases that sequences have different
lengths.
2b. Do as for 2a, but make your functions recursive (like OCaml).
Call them seqaddr and seqmultr.
2c. Do it again. This time use list comprehensions instead of iteration or recursion.

# Question 3

"""
Write functions
● ismatrix
This should input a list of list of integers (henceforth an intmatrix) and test whether a list
of lists of integers represents a matrix (so the length of each row should be equal).
● matrixshape
This should input an intmatrix and return the size of the matrix, which is the number of rows and the number of columns 
(traditionally the number of rows is given first, but if you have done it the other way around that’s fine; 
just make sure to clearly explain your code). 

● matrixadd
Matrix addition, which is simply pointwise addition.
● matrixmult
Similarly for matrix multiplication.
You do not need to write error-handling code, e.g. for the cases that inputs do not represent
matrices or represent matrixes of the wrong shapes; so for instance your matrixshape may 
assume that the argument has successfully passed the test ismatrix.
Your answer can use iteration, recursion, list comprehension, or anonymous functions. You
should not appeal to any libraries, e.g. for matrix processing.  Don't use zip.

"""

Mutable vs Immutable types

In Python, the mutable type objects are items with static values, which never change. In this programming language, all items and values are inherited from the "object" so there are no "pure values". For that reason, some built-in types have their inner value an immutable form, to not break the formal logic and object-oriented programming principles. The basic programming types, "bool", "int" and "float", are completely static because it avoids horrible errors that break the laws of mathematics and logic since it has to no good purpose to do so.
The "tuple", "string" and "frozenset" types are defined by the user but their values can not change after being created since these types do not have functions to mutate their inner value. However, these types might have functions that return other objects resultant from the original object, without changing any of its properties. This ensures the programmer that the values will remain intact throughout the python script interpretation.
The mutable types are objects that can have their inner value changed. this property is very useful for the procedural programming paradigm as the values in the memory location must the updated according to the intended procedure, instead of just continuously taking more memory to store new values resultant from existing ones. The mutable types include "list", "tuple", "set" and "dictionaries". Additionally, the "frozenset" is inherited from the "set" and it is used, for example, in "dictionaries" as "key" since this data structure associates an immutable "key" to a "value".


Integer vs float types

Integers, in the python programming language, represent numbers the whole number values. The representation of a number is accomplished by allocating the same amount of memory for every integer because for a computer's memory there is no distinction between "0" and the integer maximum value. The integer's memory architecture uses all the bits to store the whole number value, apart from the first bit which determines if the value is positive or negative. As a result of the integer's representation having a low precision of 1 since it is dealing with the whole numbers, the computer finite memory can store these values with relative ease. Additionally, python will display numbers in the form of a "string of numbers" if the number is bigger than the memory available, event thought the computer's limited memory is not capable of processing those huge values.
However, the memory representation of a float value is completely different since it deals with fractional numbers with variable precision. For this reason, the memory architecture for this type of numbers takes more space than an integer value with constant precision. As a result, to switch between integers and floats it is necessary to use built-in constructors to cast the new number values into the computer memory.

impossible for a machine with finite memory), but for any finite but unbounded number of calls
